# Verification-of-AHB-Bus-Interface-with-Multiple-Slave-Devices
 AHB interface connected to two slaves, an SRAM and a FIFO, using the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM). The verification environment comprised UVM components such as drivers, monitors, sequences, and a scoreboard. Test cases were developed to thoroughly exercise the interface, ensuring compliance with the AHB protocol and verifying the correctness of data transactions.
